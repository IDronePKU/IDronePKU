The IDrone team at the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, School of Mechanics and Engineering Science, Peking University, is dedicated to the research and application of multi-UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) systems. Our research spans interdisciplinary fields, including the design, implementation, experimental evaluation, and real-world application of complex UAV systems. 

Team members focus on areas such as motion and trajectory planning, motion generation, control, communication, coordination, and stability, covering ground, aerial, and modular robot swarms. On the application side, IDrone is committed to safety-critical systems, UAV swarm environmental monitoring, air-ground robot self-stabilizing formations, and the use of modular robots in search and rescue missions. 

Our team consists of undergraduate students, master's students, PhD candidates, and experienced researchers, working collaboratively to deploy and apply multi-robot systems in real-world complex environments.
